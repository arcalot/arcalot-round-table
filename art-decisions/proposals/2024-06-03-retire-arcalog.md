# Retire Arcalog project

The Arcalog project will be retired and all of its assets archived.

## Voting Period

The voting period for this proposal will be open for 10 working days from its
submission.

## Benefits

The Arcalog project has had no development and no commitment to maintenance for more
than a year. Removing Arcalog from all of the main entrypoints into the project will
allow us to better focus on Arcaflow as the main entrypoint of the community.

## Drawbacks

Removing the project isolates the community to a single project effort in Arcaflow
instead of the broader scope of tools once envisioned for Arcalot.
