# Implement Arcaflow Roadmap

Arcaflow should have a high-level roadmap used to guide the project's strategic
direction. The roadmap should be kept as a ROADMAP.md file in the
[.github](https://github.com/arcalot/.github) with other community documents. The
roadmap should be be time- and dependency-based, defining the major ambitions we have
for the Arcaflow project as a community. The roadmap should not duplicate or restate
efforts that are already tracked in Issues or Pull Requests, but it may reference them
as sub-efforts or dependencies. The roadmap should be reviewed and updated routinely
as part of regular community meetings.

## Voting Period

The voting period for this proposal will be open for 10 working days from its submission.

## Benefits

The roadmap will help us focus as a community on our major strategic priorities for
Arcaflow. It is also required to have a defined roadmap as part of a CNCF submission.

## Drawbacks

The roadmap becomes another planning tool to maintain and could become stale if we do
not ensure it is part of our regular processes to review and update.
