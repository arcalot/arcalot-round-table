# GitHub Configuration as Code

Automate and manage GitHub configuration with [OPenTofu][1]

## Voting Period

The voting period for this proposal will be open for 10 days from its submission.

## Benefits

OpenTofu is typically not used to configure GitHub repositories directly;
instead, it is primarily used for infrastructure as code (IaC) to provision and
manage cloud resources and infrastructure components. However, there might be
scenarios where we would want to use it in conjunction with GitHub
repositories or GitHub Actions to automate and manage certain aspects of our
GitHub configuration. Here are some reasons why we might consider using
it for such tasks:

1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Consistency: If the development workflow relies
heavily on GitHub repositories, using OpenTofu allows to define and maintain
GitHub configuration as code, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across
all current and future projects.

2. Automated Repository Setup: OpenTofu can be used to automate the creation of
GitHub repositories, organizations, teams, and access controls. This can be
especially useful if we have a large number of repositories to manage or need to
set up repositories with a specific structure or permissions.

3. Integration with Other Infrastructure: If our application's infrastructure is
defined and managed using OpenTofu, we can integrate our GitHub repository
setup into our broader infrastructure provisioning process. For example, we
might need to create a new repository as part of deploying a new application.

4. Version Control and Collaboration: Just like with infrastructure code,
storing our GitHub configuration in version-controlled OpenTofu code enables
collaboration, code review, and change tracking. We can use Git to manage
changes to our GitHub configurations.

5. Documentation and Compliance: By defining our GitHub configurations in
OpenTofu, we can create documentation that describes our organization's GitHub
policies, repository structures, and access controls. This documentation can be
versioned alongside the codebase.

6. Cross-Cloud and Multi-Platform Environments: If our organization uses
multiple cloud providers or platforms and needs to manage GitHub repositories
across them, OpenTofu provides a unified way to define and manage these
resources.

7. Scaling and Managing Growth: As the organization grows, we may need to create
and manage numerous repositories. OpenTofu allows to scale the GitHub
repository management processes efficiently.

8. Change Management: With OpenTofu, we can easily make changes to our GitHub
configurations, such as adding or removing collaborators, updating team
permissions, or modifying repository settings, all while maintaining version
history and change tracking.

In summary, while OpenTofu is not the primary tool for configuring GitHub
repositories, it can be a valuable addition to our DevOps toolkit when we need
to automate, manage, and maintain GitHub configurations in a consistent and
reproducible manner, especially in the context of larger infrastructure and
development workflows.
